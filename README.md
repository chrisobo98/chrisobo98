### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a SaaS app on the side while handling web development projects for small and large businesses, primarily located in Central Florida. I also do freelancing, with projects taking me to places like Virginia, New York, Colorado, California, and even Australia.
- ðŸŒ± ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AI agent frameworks, which are platforms that simplify the creation, deployment, and management of AI agents.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on building cool projects, especially those with a social good angle or a mission-driven purpose.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with creating a custom library for JavaScript components that is clean, simple to use, and doesnâ€™t come with the mess of a typical template library. I'm aiming for code thatâ€™s ready to plug in and useâ€”no clutter, no nonsense.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Nuxt! Iâ€™m passionate about Nuxt and its modules, best practices, and everything in between.
